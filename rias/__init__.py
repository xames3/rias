This module initializes the Rias framework, setting up the necessary
imports and configurations required for the framework to function
properly.

The Rias project provides a comprehensive framework for machine learning
workflow management, enabling users to easily fetch datasets, write
custom models, train them, and deploy to various cloud services. It
relies on a community of contributors who write plugins or components to
extend its functionality.
