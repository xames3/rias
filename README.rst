Rias
====

A little introduction and a humble attempt at a convincing elevator pitch...

Ideology
--------

Rias is yet another Machine Learning developing or streamlining framework
designed to transform and more so help Engineers or Data Scientists approach
the end-to-end Machine Learning pipelines similar to `AutoML`_. Although,
there's nothing new that I'm trying to achieve here as a lot of amazing
open-source tools are already available out there. My goal with Rias is to
empower the end users and contributors alike to simplify various intermediate
and niche steps that developers, researchers or enterprises come across every
single time while working on their Machine Learning projects. By integrating
the best development and designing practices and leveraging the power of
community-driven development, Rias aims to be the entry-point solution for
both novice and experienced Machine Learning practitioners.

The core strength of Rias lies in its extensibility. I understand that the
field of Machine Learning is vast and constantly evolving, which is why my goal
with developing Rias is to build it with modularity and adaptability. At the
center of this modularity is Rias' robust plugin/extension or agent system.
Contributors from around the world can develop and share plugins or agents that
extend Rias' functionality. These plugins can be easily developed and
integrated, allowing the end users to customize and adapt their specific
workflows without needing to dive into the complexities of the framework
itself.

The whole concept of developing Rias stems from my experiences while
contributing to and maintaining `Django`_ and utilizing the plugins and
extensions for `Sphinx`_ and `Flask`_. I've drawn inspiration from these
frameworks to create a system that is powerful, flexible and safe all at the
same time. For instance, whether you're dealing with data preprocessing, model
optimization, or deployment to cloud environments, Rias has you covered. The
framework abstracts away the underlying technicalities, letting you, the end
user or researchers focus on what truly matters -- building and deploying
effective Machine Learning models.
